## Description

A WordPress plugin to extend the core plugins search. You can sort results by ratings, name, most download, last updated, and active installs.

> The plugins API doesn't allow us to sort search results globally, so they're sorted separately on each page.
> > We're confident that you'll be able to find the plugin you're looking for on the first page of results, which has 100 items.
